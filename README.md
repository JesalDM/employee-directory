Employee Directory created using React

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Description
This application is useful to an employee or manager who would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. When the user loads the page, a table of employees will render generated using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), that will display personal information of the employees like Image, Name, phone, email, date-of-birth(YYYY-MM-DD format), gender and Nationality

The user also has the ability able to:

  * Sort the table by the Name column in ascending order. This can be done by clicking on the Name Header itself.

  * Filter/search for the table results by email. The user can search by entering some letters that are contained within the email and click on Search to bring only those results that match the letters.

  * The Clear button can be used to return the original results back unfiltered or unsorted.
